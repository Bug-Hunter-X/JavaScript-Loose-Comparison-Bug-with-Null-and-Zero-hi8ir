This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison (==) with null and zero. The bug arises from the fact that 0 == null evaluates to true in JavaScript. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).
